    "# Q3: Quadrotor Reorientation (40 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will use the trajectory optimization tools you have demonstrated in questions one and two to solve for a collision free reorientation of three planar quadrotors. The planar quadrotor (as described in lecture 9) is described with the following state and dynamics: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align} x = \\begin{bmatrix} p_x \\\\ p_z \\\\ \\theta \\\\ v_x \\\\ v_z \\\\ \\omega \\end{bmatrix}, &\\quad \\quad  \\end{align} \\dot{x} = \\begin{bmatrix}v_x \\\\ v_z \\\\ \\omega \\\\ \\frac{1}{m}(u_1 + u_2)\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\frac{1}{m}(u_1 + u_2)\\cos\\theta \\\\ \\frac{\\ell}{2J}(u_2 - u_1)\\end{bmatrix} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $p_x$ and $p_z$ are the horizontal and vertial positions, $v_x$ and $v_z$ are the corresponding velocities, $\\theta$ for orientation, $\\omega$ for angular velocity, $\\ell$ for length of the quadrotor, $m$ for mass, $g$ for gravity acceleration in the $-z$ direction, and a moment of inertia of $J$. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to use any solver/cost/constraint you would like to solve for three collision free, dynamically feasible trajectories for these quadrotors that looks something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"quadrotor_reorient.gif\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "(if an animation doesn't load here, check out `quadrotor_reorient.gif`.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the performance requirements that the resulting trajectories must meet: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The three quadrotors must start at `x1ic`, `x2ic`, and `x2ic` as shown in the code (these are the initial conditions).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The three quadrotors must finish their trajectories within **.2** meters of `x1g`, `x2g`, and `x2g` (these are the goal states). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The three quadrotors must never be within **0.8** meters of one another (use $[p_x,p_z]$ for this).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways of going about this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cost Shaping**: Design cost functions for each quadrotor that motivates them to take paths that do not result in a collision. You can do something like designing a reference trajectory for each quadrotor to use in the cost. You can use iLQR or DIRCOL for this.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collision Constraints**: You can optimize over all three quadrotors at once by creating a new state $\\tilde{x} = [x_1^T,x_2^T,x_3^T]^T$ and control $\\tilde{u} = [u_1^T,u_2^T,u_3^T]^T$, and then directly include collision avoidance constraints.  In order to use constraints, you must use DIRCOL (at least for now). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should not use `norm() >= R` in any constraints, instead you should square the constraint to be `norm()^2 >= R^2`. This second constraint is still non-convex, but it is differentiable everywhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are using DIRCOL, you can initialize the solver with a \"guess\" solution by linearly interpolating between the initial and terminal conditions. Julia let's you create a length N linear interpolated vector of vectors between `a::Vector` and `b::Vector` like this: `range(a, b, length = N)` (experiment with this to see how it works). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use either RK4 (iLQR or DIRCOL) or Hermite-Simpson (DIRCOL) for your integration. The `dt = 0.2`, and `tf = 5.0` are given for you in the code (you may change these but only if you feel you really have to). "
